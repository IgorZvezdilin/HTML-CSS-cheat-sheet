# HTML and CSS CHEATSHEET

Hi there! My name is Igor. This project has created to train my skills to use html and css. 
At this project I introduce the most popular tags and atributes, by my opinion. I try to create this cheatsheet quite compact and interactive, so i added a few pseudo classes in css.

I believe that it will be usefull for novice developers.
